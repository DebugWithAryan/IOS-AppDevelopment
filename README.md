- 🖼️ Image aspect ratio handling

**Code Highlights:**
```swift
// Layered layout with ZStack
ZStack {
    Color(.systemMint).ignoresSafeArea()

func deal() {
    let playerCardValue = Int.random(in: 2...14)
    let cpuCardValue = Int.random(in: 2...14)
    
    // Update scores based on comparison
    if playerCardValue > cpuCardValue {
        playerScore += 1
    }
}
```

- 💡 Color-coded health categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- 📝 Personalized health advice based on BMI
- ✨ Input validation with disabled state
- 🎯 Reusable InputFieldView component

**Code Highlights:**
```swift
// Computed property for validation
private var isInputValid: Bool {
    guard let w = Double(weight), let h = Double(height),
          w > 0, h > 0 else { return false }
    return true
}

// Tuple return for complex data
private func interpretBMI(_ bmi: Double) -> (category: String, color: Color, advice: String) {
    switch bmi {
    case ..<18.5:
        return ("Underweight", .blue, "You may need to gain weight...")
    case 18.5..<25:
        return ("Normal", .green, "Great! You're in a healthy weight range.")
    // ...
    }
}

// Smooth animations
withAnimation(.spring()) {
    showingResult = true
}
```

## 💭 Reflections

### What I've Learned
Each project has taught me something valuable:
- **My First App** showed me how intuitive SwiftUI's declarative syntax is
- **War Card Game** taught me how state management makes apps interactive
- **BMI Calculator** demonstrated the power of component reusability and data modeling

### Challenges Overcome
- Understanding the difference between `@State` and `@Binding`
- Debugging layout issues with nested stacks
- Implementing proper input validation
- Managing optional values safely

### What's Next
I'm excited to dive into data persistence and build my To-Do List app. After that, I'll explore networking and API integration to build real-world apps!
